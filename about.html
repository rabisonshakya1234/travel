			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>“Bhote” roughly translates as a river from “Tibet” so there are quite a lot of rivers with this name in Nepal. This Bhotekoshi is the main branch of the SunKoshi and it has been descended by kayak from near the Tibetan border at Kodari. The river is followed by the Araniko Highway from Kathmandu to Lhasa so access and scouting are relatively easy.

                The highway is normally blocked by landslides above Kodari so there is usually little traffic. The river drops very steeply before Kodari as a youthful mountain torrent; then the gradient gradually eases off to become quite placid and relaxing before Dolalghat.
                
                Technically, the Bhotekoshi ends just after Bahrabise where the SunKoshi joins as a stream from the left: we have taken our description down to Dolalghat as this is where most Sun-Koshi raft trips start. The upper valley above Bahrabise is impressively steep and narrow, and there are some dramatic and scenic gorges down at river level. Just to drive up the highway and look at the river is like reading an erotic novel – it quickens the blood and excites the mind!
                
                A dam at Lamasangu takes water out of the river for a few kilometers but luckily has not spoilt the most beautiful sections of the river. The river below the dam is quite different -the section down to Dolalghat has well-wooded sides and a wide blue river winding between white beaches.</p>
